LP problems are about finding the most optimal solution
for the objective function, under certain constraints like inequalities

Referring to the inequalities I have, I recognize that I need
3 basic variables to get the most optimized objective function.

Ultimately, I need to pivot on all possible basic variables,
until I identify which variables are needed to be pivoted.

When looking at the inequalities, we see that all X >= 0.

So, if any of my (row, col) is negative, then it's infeasible value.

Among all the feasible values, the highest one is the correct answer.
